    <strong>To do</strong><br><br>

    <strong>Your follow-up to do list:</strong> Although you can choose to follow-up with any client at any time in the Feedback page. Here, you will find results you really should follow-up with. 
    <br><br>
    <strong>Why?</strong> Any score between 0 and 6 automatically appears here. If we’ve asked a client for feedback and they’ve scored in this range then the least we can do is check-in with them to thank them for their feedback and learn more.
