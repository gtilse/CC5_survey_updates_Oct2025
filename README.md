## What Changed? (Oct 25-27, 2025)

### Critical Fixes

✅ **Reminder Timing Bug** (MOST CRITICAL)
- Australian reminders were 23 hours early → Now correct time
- UK reminders were at midnight → Now during business hours
- All timezones now within 2-hour accuracy
- Added 30-day safety window to prevent old reminders from sending
- Cron changed: Daily (1x) → Every 2 hours (12x/day)

### UX Improvements

✅ **Mobile Experience**
- Hidden NPS context section (prevents "wall of buttons" confusion)
- Full-width Submit button, fully visible
- Stacked vertical layout on mobile
- Significantly improved mobile conversion rate

✅ **Auto-Close Behavior**
- Fixed: Score page closes after redirecting to feedback form
- User ends with only feedback form open (can review thank you message)
- Was closing wrong window before

✅ **Footer & Branding**
- Footer always visible without scrolling
- Firm name pass-through working (score page → feedback form → thank you)
- Footer text consistency: "firms" (not "professionals")
- Favicon added to all templates

### Architecture Changes

✅ **Three-Template System**
- NEW: `email_template_reminder_single.html` (default single button)
- Simplified default reminder flow (matches initial emails)
- Optional inline scores per vendor via manual switch
- Better separation of concerns

✅ **Database Cleanup**
- Removed 39,000 old reminders (dating from 2017)
- Current reminder count: ~1,000 scheduled this week
- Optimized for performance

## Emergency Restoration

If production files are lost or corrupted:

```bash
# Connect to your local machine (where this backup exists)
cd /Users/gregtilse/projects/clientculture/survey_docs/production_backup_oct27_2025/

# Upload all files to production
scp -i ~/projects/pem/KlientKulture.pem \
  index.html app.js styles.css \
  email_template_*.html \
  survey_emailer.php survey.php background_job.php \
  numbertowordsconverter.js \
  ec2-user@clientculture.net:/var/www/html/survey/

# Verify
ssh -i ~/projects/pem/KlientKulture.pem ec2-user@clientculture.net \
  "ls -lh /var/www/html/survey/"
```

**Time Required:** ~5 minutes
**See:** BACKUP_MANIFEST.md for detailed restoration procedures

## Sync to GitHub

Production is currently ahead of GitHub by ~5 days of improvements.

**Recommended Approach:**

1. Read [GITHUB_SYNC_STRATEGY.md](./GITHUB_SYNC_STRATEGY.md)
2. Use "Detailed Commits + Pull Request" method
3. Create 7 individual commits (preserves development timeline)
4. Create PR for developer review
5. Merge when approved

**Time Required:** <1 hour
**Result:** Clean git history, full documentation, developer can review changes
